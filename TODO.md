## Immediate ##
### LLAP sensor message handling ###
 - remember timestamp (when was the last message received)
 - allow for "disabling" the display/processing the messages?
 - refactor variables: make one object for one sensor
 - do something about STARTED/AWAKE/SLEEPING messages?

## Eventually ##
 - Implement Log section (last couple of things pulled when connected, then each time a message comes, add it to the log locally)
 - Phone-friendly version of the site
